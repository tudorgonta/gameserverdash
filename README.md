# **SimpleGameHosting Frontend Coding Assignment**

Welcome to the SimpleGameHosting coding assignment! 🎉 We’re excited to see your skills in action. This assignment is designed to assess your ability to create clean, reusable, and well-styled React components while working with Tailwind CSS and JSON data.

---

## **Overview**

Your task is to build a dynamic card-based UI to display server details fetched from an API endpoint. You’ll use React, Tailwind CSS, and optionally other libraries, to create an elegant, responsive layout.

The provided code already fetches server data from a mock API and displays it as JSON on the page. Your job is to replace the JSON display with a set of styled, reusable **ServerCard** components.

---

## **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version v22.12.0 or higher
- **npm**: Version 11.0 or higher (or preferred package manager)
- A code editor, like **VSCode** or **NeoVim**

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/simplegamehosting/frontend-assignment.git
   ```
   ```
   cd frontend-assignment
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

# **Your Task**

1. **Build a Reusable Card Component**:

   - Display the following details about each server:

     - **Server Name**
     - **Game Name**
     - **Player Count**
     - **Server Status** (e.g., "Online"/"Offline")
     - **Version**

   - Bonus points for displaying any additional data creatively.

2. **Use Tailwind CSS**:

   - Style the card components using Tailwind CSS. Feel free to reference the existing styles in the codebase.

3. **Responsiveness**:

   - Ensure the cards look great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

4. **Optional Extras**:

   - Add a **light/dark mode toggle**.
   - **Organize your component into a separated components directory**.

5. **Push Your Work**:
   - When complete, push your work to a **public GitHub repository** and share the link with us.

# **Evaluation Criteria**

We’ll evaluate your submission based on:

1. **Functionality**:

   - Does the card display all server data correctly?
   - Are the interactive features (if added) working as expected?

2. **Code Quality**:

   - Is the code modular, reusable, and clean?
   - Does it follow React and Tailwind best practices?

3. **Design and Styling**:

   - Is the design modern, responsive, and visually appealing?

4. **Extra Features**:
   - Have you gone above and beyond to add optional extras or improve the UX?

# **Submission** 📤

1. **Complete the assignment** and thoroughly test your work to ensure everything functions as expected.
2. **Push your code** to a **public GitHub repository** for us to review.
3. **Share the repository link** with us by replying to the email that sent you the original assignment link.

We’re looking forward to seeing what you build! 💻✨

# **FAQs**

### 🤔 Can I use third-party UI libraries?

Yes, you can use any libraries (e.g., `react-icons`, `shadCN`) to help you build the UI. Feel free to leverage tools that make your work efficient and stylish! ✨

### 🤖 Can I use AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot?

Yes, as long as you fully understand the code that’s being generated. It will be obvious if you don’t, so make sure you review and adapt the code where necessary. Be smart about using AI to assist your creativity, not replace it! 🚀
